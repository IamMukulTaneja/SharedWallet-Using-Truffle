# SharedWallet-Using-Truffle

##Motto : This project aims to understand the concepts of truffle and smart contract like how to do testing of contracts,how to interact with local ethereum node,how to deploy contract on it and other concepts.

This project includes one smart contract which is MyWallet.The basic explanation of that contract is:

It is basically enables the account which has deplyed this contract to send ether to any one without confirmation but it is not allowing any other account to send ether through this contract. Despite this, other account can give the proposal to the main account that it wants to send ether from this contract and you can accept its proposal if you think that its reason is correct.I have given the reason(string) as a parameter.

Testing :

Testing has been done to verify if all the functions in the contract worked well.

I have tested this application by connecting it to 'testrpc' and also the local go-ethereum(GETH) node.

Hope if you download it,it will work in your computer.Head to truffle docs if you need any assistance on truffle.
